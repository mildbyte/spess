  * Stations don't buy or sell goods, trading goods and services instead happens on a sector/region exchange.
  * The exchange operates similar to a stock exchange: order book for every commodity with bids and asks, bids and asks with the same price get matched.
  * To trade a good, a ship has to deposit it at the exchange in its account. The exchange charges a storage fee for the goods.
  * Placing a sell order means the goods are put into escrow.
  * Placing a buy order means some money from the account is put into escrow.
  * A ship could even trade without actually being physically present at the exchange (speculation). But does that mean all prices on every exchange will be the same, since any discrepancies will be taken advantage of?
  * Stations actually need goods, so they must encourage agents to deliver the goods to them and not just gamble with them on the exchange.
